# shells-helper

This binary is installed on Shells linux hosts running user graphical sessions
in order to pass notifications from the Shells instance to the Shells system,
and then to the user's notification enabled devices.

For example for a user connecting to Shells with an iPhone, notifications
happening inside the guest OS while the user is not connected will still
result in notifications shown on the phone's screen.
